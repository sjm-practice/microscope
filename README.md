The app from the Discover Meteor book / tutorial (done as a  code along).

https://book.discovermeteor.com/

## Notes
* 'var' keyword, when declaring an object/item, limits the scope to the current file
    - declaring an object item without 'var' makes it global
* Meteor/Mongo
    - find returns a cursor (which is a reactive data source)
    - fetch transforms cursor in to an array
    - NOTE: a Meteor app however, can iterate over a cursor. so fetch is used when you explicitly would like the data in an array
